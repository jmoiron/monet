# Gallery

This app was written for a version of monet that was very different:

* it used https://github.com/hoisie/web instead of net/http and chi
* it used a custom template engine called mandira (based on handlebars) instead of html/template
* it used MongoDB instead of sqlite & sqlx

Given this, it doesn't compile. It's being kept here if/when I want to port it.
